# KS (with Oxytropis promoters)
<!-- multiple significant motifs, only one of them of interest, the rest are TATA boxes or just repeated A's -->
<!-- Phvul.004G051100 which was first classified into Kn, then removed since it appears that it is a K2S, after alignment it looks like it's KS, with a 2nd segment similar to K; created new file KS_20130910.fas with Oxytropis and Phvul.004G051100 promoters -->

## Seeder

<!-- removed 3 flanking nucleotides to keep the core 6 bps -->

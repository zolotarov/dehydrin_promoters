# De novo motif discovery in the promoters of acidic and basic dehydrins

## Acidic dehydrins

Using MEME, 10 significant motifs were discovered from a set containing 139 promoters. Out of 10 motifs, 2 match ABREs, 3 match CBF/DRE, 1 light and 2 auxin (one overlaps with ABRE)


## Basic dehydrins

9 motifs were discovered among 95 promoters of basic dehydrins.  5 matches were ABREs, 2 matches DREs, with lower confidence as opposed to acidic dehydrins, 1 light, 1 auxin, 1 pathogen response. There’s an overlap between the matches.


{Rahman:2013fe} hinted at NLS located within an SKn dehydrin, using NLStradamus (http://www.moseslab.csb.utoronto.ca/NLStradamus/) NLS was identified in most YnSKn and SKn dehydrin and it overlapped with the K-segment. In addition, acidic Thellungiella dehydrin stabilized lipid monolayer at 4 °C, whereas the basic stabilized lipid monolayer at room temperature. Given the fact that in acidic dehydrins, the cold motifs are perfect matches and in basic dehydrins they are not, it is possible that aicidic dehydrins are involved in ABA-dependent and independent response, whereas basic are involved only in ABA-dependent.

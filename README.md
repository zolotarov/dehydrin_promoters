# Analysis of plant dehydrin promoters

This repository contains scripts and sequences used for *de novo* motif discovery in the promoters of plant dehydrins, based on the dehydrin type.

The data is described in the following paper: [*De Novo* Regulatory Motif Discovery Identifies Significant Motifs in Promoters of Five Classes of Plant Dehydrin Genes](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0129016)
